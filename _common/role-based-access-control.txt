================================
Role-based access control (RBAC)
================================

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts access to the capabilities of Rackspace Cloud services, including the Cloud Load Balancers API, to authorized users only. RBAC enables Rackspace Cloud customers to specify which account users of their Cloud account have access to which Cloud Load Balancers API service capabilities, based on roles defined by Rackspace (see :ref:`Cloud Load Balancers product roles and capabilities <>`). The permissions to perform certain operations in Cloud Load Balancers API – create, read, update, delete  – are assigned to specific roles. The account owner user assigns these roles, either global (multiproduct) or product-specific (for example Cloud Load Balancers), to account users.

.. _devguide-rbac-assign:

Assign roles to account users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The account owner (identity:user-admin) can create account users on the account and then assign roles to those users. The roles grant the account users specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the Cloud Load Balancers service. Each account has only one account owner, and that role is assigned by default to any Rackspace Cloud account when the account is created.

See the *Cloud Identity Client Developer Guide* for information on how to perform the following tasks:

* Add account users

* Assign roles to account users

* Delete roles from account users

.. note::
    The account owner (identity:user-admin) role cannot hold any additional roles because it already has full access to all capabilities.
