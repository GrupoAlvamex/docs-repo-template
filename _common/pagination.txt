======================
Pagination of requests
======================

To reduce load on the service, list operations return a maximum number of items at a time. This is referred to as pagination.

You can set the following parameters in the URI:

-  ``limit``

 The ``limit`` parameter sets the maximum number of items returned. If the client requests a limit beyond the the number of items supported by the service, an overLimit (413) response code is returned.

-  ``marker``

 The ``marker`` parameter is the ID of the last item in the previous list. If the Id specified is invalid, a badRequest (400) response code is returned. If a marker beyond the end of a list is given, an empty list is returned. Note that the list operations never return itemNotFound (404) response codes.

To help you navigate the collection, you can set the `limit` and `marker` parameters in the URI. For example, the following request returns up to 20 pages, starting with the item with ID=1234:

.. code::

    ?limit=20&marker=1234

.. Check with your development teams about whether they support page_reverse and offset for pagination. Pagination-template.txt contains information about these parameters.

.. Check with your development teams about whether they support next and previous links for pagination. Pagination-template.txt contains information about these links.
