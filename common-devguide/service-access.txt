Service access and endpoints
============================

The <specificService> service is a regionalized service. It allows the caller to select a 
region in which to provision the service.

.. tip::
   To help you decide which regionalized endpoint to use, read about `special considerations for choosing a region`_.

Replace the {tenantID} placeholder with your actual account number, which is returned as 
part of the authentication service response, after the final ``/`` in the ``publicURL`` field. 

.. note:
   Best practice: Always copy the base URLs directly from the service catalog rather than 
   trying to construct them manually, because the catalog is always up-to-date.

When your Rackspace cloud service resources reside in the same region, devices are in close 
proximity to each other and can take advantage of ServiceNet connectivity for free data transfer 
between services.

.. note::
   ServiceNet is an internal Rackspace-only, multi-tenant network connection within each 
   Rackspace datacenter. ServiceNet IPs are not accessible via the public internet. Rackspace 
   customers can configure resources to use an internal IP address so that traffic over 
   the ServiceNet network is not billed.
