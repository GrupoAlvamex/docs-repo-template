.. For the servicetype value, enter the service type value from the service catalog, for example rax:databases.

Replace the ``$TENANT_ID`` with your Rackspace Cloud account number. 

..  note:: 

      You can find the complete URI, with your account number appended in the service catalog that is returned in the  
      :ref:`authentication response <review-auth-resp>`. Search 
      the catalog for the service type, |servicetype|. Then, copy the URI from the 
      *publicURL* field for the region you want to use.
